And the first Month of the year is already over, lets see what happened

First: the OpenMage project did start a public Discord Server as communication channel
You can join via [https://discord.gg/EV8aNbU]()
In case you prefer a different one, suggest one at [https://github.com/OpenMage/organizational/issues/2]()

Second: Some but not all of you know, that you can support my Open Source Work via Patreon [https://www.patreon.com/Flyingmana]()
And you can not only follow me there, you can also influence what I should work on next.
