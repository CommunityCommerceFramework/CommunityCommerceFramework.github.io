title: Hellow World - We are up and running!

Still setting up a bit the website and a Blog part. Not sure yet if we will use this place as primary point for the blog, or if we will take Medium or a Wordpress somewhen.

On the roadmap for the website:

* a easy to read overview of all changes compared to M1 (You know, Magento Version 1)
* an easy to follow tutorial of getting a local instance running

And a reminder.
We dont want to become a competitor of Magento. We want to be a competitor to all the smaller e-commerce frameworks out there who advertise how easy to use and extend they are. Because, there are good reasons for Magento becoming more complex these days, like everything else becomes more complex which needs to be able to scale up largely. 

And a reminder, we have a Public Discord Server (address is in the Readme of the Core Repository)
